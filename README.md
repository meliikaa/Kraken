**Kraken Two-Column Article Recognition**

This repository contains code and configurations for using Kraken, a powerful Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engine, to recognize and process texts. The model has been fine-tuned to achieve accurate text extraction from documents that have a two-column layout. The work is done by the Python course from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, on Coursera.

Introduction

Kraken is an open-source OCR engine designed to process scanned documents and images containing printed text. It utilizes neural networks to recognize characters and words from input images. In this project, we have tailored Kraken's model to efficiently handle two-column articles commonly found in research papers, academic journals, and magazines.
Installation

To use this project, you need to have Kraken and its dependencies installed. You can install Kraken using pip:



pip install kraken

For more detailed installation instructions and information on additional requirements, refer to Kraken's official documentation.

Usage

The main usage of this project is to extract text from two-column articles in scanned images. The repository includes sample code to demonstrate how to use Kraken for this purpose.

Credits

The fine-tuning of Kraken for two-column article recognition was completed as part of the Python course offered by the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, on Coursera. We are grateful for the knowledge and support provided by the instructors and course content, which made this project possible.
